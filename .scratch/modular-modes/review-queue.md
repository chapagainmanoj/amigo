# Modes build review queue

## Phase 0 — 2026-10-22

- Commit: `ac6b235` (housekeeping; queue recorded in following slice).
- Files: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, HANDOFF.md (deleted), docs/adr/0003-mode-topics.md,
  .scratch/modular-modes/issues/03-switch-modes-with-confirmed-handoffs.md,
  .scratch/mode-expansion-planning/cbt-research-mvp/README.md,
  .scratch/mode-expansion-planning/decisions/05-cbt-research-protocol.md.
- Protected edits: AGENTS.md updated as explicitly authorized; no protected runtime/SQL edits.
- Baseline: clean develop/e73a6bd; 638 passed in 16.09s, matching spec.
- Verification: 638 passed in 14.39s; Gate A currency 111 passed in 9.87s;
  Ruff `All checks passed!`; scheduler smoke `in-memory APScheduler reminder fired through channel`;
  git diff --check passed. No live Gate A run; no model requests.
- Instruction inventory: only AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md found; CLAUDE.md now imports AGENTS.md.
  Skills preserved. Daily instructions/schema untouched.
- Decisions: build rules and lifted gates recorded; 8-request cap superseded by model ladder;
  CBT personal input disabled. Unfinished selector and pending Store/crash review moved to trackers.
- Open: Phase 3 owner test-bot spike; Phase 2 Store review; all later implementation.
